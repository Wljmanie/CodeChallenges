## The type of project
I opted for interactive server for Blazor. The reason is I want to keep it simple for now on the testing aspect.
I don't expect loads of users on this site. Otherwise static with JS would be much better.
However I just want to keep the testhing to C#. WebAssembly would have been a good choice as well.
Perhaps I make it auto after I am done.
The choice doesn't have to be optimal, since the main goal of this project is to learn.
