# Coding Challenges

## Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to learn a couple of things.
- Default dark and light theme with CSS.
- Using Tests to test the code.
- Learning and practicing Git with the terminal.
- Practicing CSS.
- Practicing Vim Motions and mouseless coding.
- Learning GitHub Actions and run the tests there.

## Steps of the project

- [x] Creating the empty project.
- [x] Creating the responsive layout with css.
- [x] Creating Flipped.
- [x] Creating the test project.
- [x] Creating tests for Flipped.
- [x] Creating Evil Olive.
- [x] Creating tests for Evil Olive.
- [x] Creating FizzBuzz.
- [ ] Creating tests for FizzBuzz.
- [ ] Creating a Mortgage calculator.
- [ ] Creating tests for Mortgage calculator.

## Flipped
A simple page that reverses a string for you.

## The Classic FizzBuzz Challenge
A simple page that shows FizzBuzz.

## Evil Olive
A simple page that checks if the input is a palindrome.

## Mortgage calculator
A simple page that calculates interest and shows monthly payments.

## The type of project
I opted for interactive server for Blazor. The reason is I want to keep it simple for now on the testing aspect.
I don't expect loads of users on this site. Otherwise static with JS would be much better.
However I just want to keep the testhing to C#. WebAssembly would have been a good choice as well.
Perhaps I make it auto after I am done.
The choice doesn't have to be optimal, since the main goal of this project is to learn.

## Additional learned things
I figured I might as well run my tests with GitHub Actions.
I had a little trouble with getting it to work, however Windows is not case sensitive, Linux is.
So I learned when referencing projects, it is case sensitive to avoid problems down the road.
